# Default Avatar Placeholder
# This file serves as a placeholder for the default avatar image.
# In a production environment, you would replace this with an actual image file (default-avatar.png)
# 
# The image should be:
# - 200x200 pixels or larger
# - PNG, JPG, or WebP format
# - Generic silhouette or icon design
# - Light theme compatible with dark mode
# 
# For now, the profile system will gracefully handle missing images by showing a CSS-generated avatar
