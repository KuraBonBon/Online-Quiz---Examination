## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If you see a blank page:
1. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (clear cache)
3. Verify server is running: Check terminal for errors

### If dark mode doesn't persist:
1. Check browser localStorage: `F12 > Application > Local Storage`
2. Look for `spist-theme` key
3. Clear and try again

### If styles look broken:
1. Check Bootstrap CDN is loading: View page source
2. Verify CSS is not cached: Hard refresh
3. Check for template syntax errors in Django debug page

### If you get a crash on login:
1. The view now has safe error handling for UserActivityLog
2. Check Django terminal for detailed error traceback
3. Verify database migrations are up to date: `python manage.py migrate`

## 📝 Notes

- **Old templates backed up**: All original templates saved with `_old` suffix
- **No data lost**: Only templates changed, database untouched
- **Reversible**: To revert, rename `_old` files back
- **Dark mode**: Stored in browser localStorage (not database)
- **Animations**: Pure CSS, no external libraries needed

---

## 🎓 How Dark Mode Works

1. **Toggle Button**: Clicking toggles between 'light' and 'dark'
2. **HTML Attribute**: Sets `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>` tag
3. **CSS Variables**: Theme-specific colors defined in `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`
4. **LocalStorage**: Theme saved to `localStorage.setItem('spist-theme', 'dark')`
5. **Persistence**: On page load, `initTheme()` reads from localStorage

---

## ✨ Animation Effects

- **Stat Numbers**: Count up from 0 to value (30 frames, 30ms interval)
- **Progress Bars**: Width animates from 0% to target (0.5s ease)
- **Chart Bars**: Height animates from 0 to target (staggered 100ms delay)
- **Card Hover**: Lift effect + shadow increase (0.3s ease)
- **Theme Toggle**: 180° rotation (0.3s ease)
- **Button Ripple**: Expanding circle effect on hover
