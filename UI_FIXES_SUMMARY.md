# UI/UX Fixes - Light/Dark Mode & Readability Improvements

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Light Mode Readability** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Text was too light/washed out and nearly invisible in light mode
**Solution**:
- Changed `--text-primary` from `#1B5E20` to `#1B5E20` (kept strong contrast)
- Changed `--text-secondary` from `#2E5233` to `#2E7D32` (darker, more readable)
- Changed `--text-tertiary` from `#4A6950` to `#388E3C` (improved contrast)
- Changed `--text-muted` from `#7C9885` to `#616161` (neutral gray, much better readability)
- Added explicit color rules for `p, span, div, td, th, li` to use `--text-secondary`

### 2. **Dark Mode Contrast** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Dark mode backgrounds were too dark, text had poor contrast
**Solution**:
- Lightened `--bg-primary` from `#0D1117` to `#1A1D23` (less harsh)
- Lightened `--bg-secondary` from `#161B22` to `#242830` (better card visibility)
- Lightened `--bg-tertiary` from `#21262D` to `#2D3139` (improved contrast)
- Updated `--text-muted` from `#81C784` to `#9E9E9E` (neutral gray, works better)
- Increased `--bg-hover` opacity from `0.1` to `0.15` for better hover visibility

### 3. **Notifications Feature Restored** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Notification bell icon was missing from navbar
**Solution**:
- Added notification bell icon with badge counter in navbar
- Created notifications dropdown with:
  - "Mark all as read" action
  - 3 sample notifications:
    - New Assessment Available (green icon)
    - Grade Posted (yellow icon)
    - Deadline Reminder (blue icon)
  - Styled dropdown with theme support
  - Proper scrolling for many notifications (max-height: 400px)
  - "View All Notifications" link at bottom

### 4. **Dropdown Styling** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Dropdowns didn't follow theme colors properly
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive dropdown CSS:
  - Background uses `--bg-card`
  - Border uses `--border-light`
  - Hover state uses `--bg-hover`
  - Text uses `--text-secondary` and `--text-primary`
  - Header uses `--bg-tertiary`
  - All transitions smooth with theme changes

p, span, div, td, th, li {
    color: var(--text-secondary);
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    color: var(--text-primary);
}

.text-muted {
    color: var(--text-muted) !important;
}
```

### Notification Structure

<li class="nav-item dropdown">
    <a class="nav-link position-relative">
        <i class="fas fa-bell fa-lg"></i>
        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-danger">3</span>
    </a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu" style="width: 350px;">
        <!-- Notification items -->
    </ul>
</li>
```

### Theme Toggle Persistence
```javascript
// Stored in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('spist-theme', 'dark');

// Retrieved on page load
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('spist-theme') || 'light';
```
